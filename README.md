Writing smart contract using cadence
## Project Description

In this project we have used basic functions and variable that have thought throughout the different modules using cadence.The main goal of this project is to get a good grip on structs and arrays in general

### Executing program
To run this program, you can use flow-playground, an online cadence IDE.
Firstly we write our smart contract by creating a new struct of your liking then create a function that can add to the array.
Then we call the function in transaction to modify or add new data into the array.Finally we use script to view the changes we made to the blockchain.

#### My Experience
I really had fun coding using solidity,this concept was very foreign to me ,i think i understood the concept and language very well. i am looking forward to complete  more modules and courses in MetaCrafters.
