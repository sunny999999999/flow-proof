writing smart contract using cadence
## Project Description

In this project we have used basic functions and variable that have thought throughout the different modules using cadence.The main goal of this project is to create your token on ethereum blockchain.And learn basic functions such as minting and burning the tokens and also writing conditional statements to reduce basic errors.

### Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). 
After writing the code according to the instructions we can test the code use the left tab showing "deploy",use can mint some coins and check the total supply and balances.

#### My Experience
I really had fun coding using solidity,this concept was very foreign to me ,i think i understood the concept and language very well. i am looking forward to complete  more modules and courses in MetaCrafters.
